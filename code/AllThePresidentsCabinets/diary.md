All the Presidents' Cabinets

Step One: Get a csv file of all Presidential Cabinet appointments from the beginning of American history. 
-Since this doesn't exist (or doesn't exist anywhere I could tell), I've created it from scratch using the following: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Secretaries_of_State_of_the_United_States 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Education#List_of_Secretaries_of_Education 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development
https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/cabinet 


Step Two: Fun with Jupyter Notebooks 
-I pulled the cleaned and created csv file into Jupyter notebook and started looking for interesting patterns based on State, years served, acting vs. sworn in, etc. I determined that one interesting way to look at this change over time data was to create a sort of timeline to anchor the piece. I think this way people who want to explore a cabinet at a certain time can, and other graphics will provide more of a summary

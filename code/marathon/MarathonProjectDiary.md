Day One:

-Getting the dataframes set up and worked into the jupyter notebook.
-Cleaning up CSVs:
  -renaming columns
  -working with regular expressions because we know each State we want is just 2 Letter abbreviation
  -Making simple references about where people come from: grouping by major American city 
  -% of people who are from a state outside of where the race is taking place 
  -Average age of M and F traveling for a race

CHARTS CREATED DAY TWO and THREE: 
-Spent the day working with age/state data...though many of the graphs that I produced were not actually interesting 


THIS TO WORK ON:
I wanted to find a way to 'map' out of state runners, but it isn't actually all that interesting geographically. 
The problem is that the datasets don't match up demographically. 

Boston --> Don't have international runners or age..making it hard to do a full comparison across all three marathons! 


What is next: 
I need to figure out how to use all of the additional information about age/gender/state included

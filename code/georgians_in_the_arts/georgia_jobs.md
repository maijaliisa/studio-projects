Goal: Atlanta, Georgia is the new Film/TV capitol of the world, as more films are shot on location in the state than any other place. Atlant also has a long history of music production, particularly in hip hop/R&B. I am interested in looking at the arts industry as a economic driver for the state.


STEP ONE: Dataset on economic trends.
Employment numbers per industry: found https://www.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm  

STEP TWO: Cleaning it up
-I ended up going back and cleaning up the CSV file before importing into Pandas, because some of the columns were messy and it was easier to just delete the things I didn't care about

STEP THREE: 
-When looking at the numbers, there are some interesting things to look at.
1) The staggering increase in Agents/Managers for Artists. 
2) Compare how Core Arts/Cultural Production Employment has grown compared with overall total employment for the state 


STEP FOUR: 
Outside data to bring in:

According to the GA Department of Revenue 

here were 245 feature film and television productions filmed in the state in 2016, according to the Georgia Department of Economic Development. The motion picture and TV industry spent more than $2 billion here last fiscal year and directly employed more than 25,700 people. 


** Atlanta is quickly growing as a tech hub for FinTech, % of fortune 500 companies....but also 'cultural capital of the US '

STEP FIVE: 
-It has been difficult to determine what is 'interesting' with the data...particularly because it is very much reported and in the local news

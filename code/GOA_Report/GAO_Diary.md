The Government Accountability Office is considered the 'Congressional Watchdog'. Every unclassified report/recommendation/finding is archived on their website with a full PDF.

I am interested in looking at how recommendations change over time. This may show some interesting insights into Congress:

1) GAO reports begin when a ranking member of Congress calls for an investigation. Knowing what reports are requested could provide some interesting/overlookied aspects of what Congress is talking about (besides the big issues that are covered in the news)

2) We can see patterns in what legislative agencies are getting the most attention from GAO...and which ones are not 

3) GAO files both recommendations about reports. I am interested in seeing how many recommendations are put into effect.

HELPFUL LINKS FOR UNDERSTANDING GAO: 
https://www.gao.gov/about/performanceaccountabilityreport/overview 
http://www.scsuntimes.com/news/20170721/government-accountability-office-to-examine-board-member-selection-process
https://www.gao.gov/about/
https://www.gao.gov/resources/journalists/overview 

STEP ONE:
*Determine how to scrape the website. Determine how I will defereniate between recommendations or just a report...or does it matter? 

*Do background research:
 - GAO does reports on the following:
 1) Executive Agencies
 2) Independent Agencies
 3) Judicial
 4) Legislative Agency
 5) Multinational Agencies
 5) Territories 

 For the purposes of this...I will only look at Executive, Judicial, Legislative Agencies

After 3 days of scraping and trying to figure out something interesting...I realized I was going down the 'cure cancer' route of everything. So I am basically starting from square one with a much more specific goal: LOOK AT OPEN PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS! 
-track by: agency, topic and date opened 

Will start a new notebook GAO_PROJECT_ATTEMPT_TWO.ipynb

STEP ONE: 
Just searching open Priority Items, I learned from my previous mistakes that scrapping this website is too much for me right now. So I just created my own CSV files of information I want to look at 

STEP TWO:
Got on the phone and emailed the Research Team at GAO....hopefully that will be more helpful....

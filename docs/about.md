Maija Liisa is a displaced Californian who found her voice - and her passion for digital storytelling - while living in and exploring Atlanta. As a graduate of Emory University and a current data journalism student at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism Lede Program, she loves creating well-researched content that connects people to new ideas. Oh...and she loves coffee. Potentially more than anything else in the world.

Check the GAO database. 

Created in the aftermath of World War I, GAO (Government Accountability Office) serves as the auditing arm of the Federal Government and investigates any agency or deparment that receives public funds. As Congress' "official watchdog", GAO provides reports where audits turn up cases of "fraud, waste or mismanagement" within an agency. 

As a non-partisan agency within the US Federal Government, GAO provides a crucial service in a democratic society. But understanding where GAO focuces most of its audit and reporting time also gives a unique perspective on how the US government is functioning at any time.

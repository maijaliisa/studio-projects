# Traveling Runners: Where LA, Boston and Chicago Marathon Finishers Live (2016/2017)

Part of marathon's appeal is its sheer spectacle. The average runner trains for several months in order to run for five hours straight. 0.8 per 100,000 marathon participants will experience sudden cardiac arrest. And yet, over half a million Americans hit the pavement last year to compete in one of the countries' races. And while running is a hobby (or more of a labor of love), it is also a unique sector of the travel industry. 

Of the top 5 biggest marathons on 2016/2017, __% traveled out of state or out of the country.

Qualifying for the Boston Marathon is based on time/age rates, making it one of the most competitive races for which you can gain entry. But other large races, such as LA and Chicago, have a slightly more open registration system. But people will still travel in order to compete.
